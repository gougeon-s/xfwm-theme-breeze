# xfwm-theme-breeze
A clone of KDE/Plasma 5's "Breeze" window manager theme. It is designed to go well with the [Breeze GTK theme offered by manjaro](https://gitlab.manjaro.org/artwork/themes/breath-gtk).

![Xfce theme Breeze](https://preview.redd.it/qm3roqr5kc831.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=82ff500116e430c27f07a8e3d54dc02d3d291ced)

Some of the "pressed" states are missing their own assets. The theme is simple small and just work.
Feel free to fork this and add any feature you thing is needed.

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/larmedina75/xfwm-theme-breeze.git ~/.themes/Breeze-xfwm

You can of course call it whatever you like on your local machine.
